# DiscordTextHistoryBot
A bot that detects your past messages and tells you your talking statistics, what sort of person you are and how you talk.
This bot has a lot of functionality, and a lot of commands. The commands are shown when the bot is started and you can get feedback on how you talk.
There were many errors using the deepseek API that hackclub provides. But we figured it out, though the problem is that it doesnt send in DMs but you can still get the output in terminal when you run the command to improve your messages. The API does slow down the bot quite a bit so beware. This bot contains a level system and it also has a list of bad words that you cant say, (just robbed it off of a github page that was free to use): https://github.com/etylermoss/swears/tree/master/inputs DO NOT open that if you dont want to see a list of cuss words. The bot removes levels when you swear, gives you levels overtime and it also stores emojis and words in a list for each user seperately so there are cool commands to show you what emojis you sent.
